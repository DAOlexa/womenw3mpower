 ```Women W3mpowerment```

An initiative that aims to educate female legal professionals on crypto, blockchain and Web3 and support their transition to the industry. 

The goal is to create a she-buddy networking and continuous educational environment where women feel safe and empowered to build their careers and establish themselves as industry leading professionals. 

Our initiative targets women, and those that identify as women, of underrepresented communities and regions that might not have had equal opportunities to get access to education and necessary tooling to seek their career in the blockchain industry.

With this initiative we aim to address: 
- the gender gap and lack of female representation in the blockchain industry 
- the lack of legal and compliance professionals that have necessary knowledge and skills to cater to the needs of the industry 
- the lack of diversity and inclusion of underpriviliged communities, such as women of Africa, women of India, women of South Asia, women on the Balkans 

History shows that the technology and financial sectors have always been male-dominated. Although women outnumber men at the education level, when it comes to participation and collaboration in tech-oriented services, men outnumber women. 

Despite the recent hypergrowth of the blockchain industry, women still remain underrepresented in the fields of technology and web3 in general. 

Women make up only **28.8% of the tech workforce** with **only 16% of women in senior-level tech jobs** and **10% in executive positions**. 

Moreover, **Black**, **Multiracial**, **Indigenous**, **Pacific Islander**, and **Latin** Women made up the bottom **6% of all tech industry new hires**. 

**Female-founded blockchain projects** received **only 2%** of venture capital in 2020. 

These statistics only show that access for women to tech education and career opportunities is still limited, which tends to hold them back from achieving their highest potential. 

The blockchain industry is an environment where the skills and talent of an individual are valued more than their background and identity, and it breaks away from the norm that currently exists and poses an opportunity for women to come onboard and make their place in the field.
